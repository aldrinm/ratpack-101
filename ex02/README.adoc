Introductory workshop about http://ratpack.io[Ratpack].

== Creating Ratpack projects with Lazybones and running them with Gradle (10 minutes)

https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[Lazybones] is a scaffolding tool to generate application skeletons for different projects, and it's the recommended option for bootstrapping a Ratpack application.

Letâ€™s create a Ratpack project in the current directory:

 lazybones create ratpack . 

[WARNING]
====
The default Ratpack template comes with Spring Loaded 1.2.1 for hot-swapping code changes while the application is running. That version https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/issues/654[has a bug that it's fixed in the 1.2.3 release]. The new template will be available with the new Ratpack release, but meanwhile, make sure you are using the correct Spring Loaded version:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
...
  springloaded "org.springframework:springloaded:1.2.3.RELEASE"
...
----

====

After that, you can run the application with Gradle:

 ./gradlew run

== Examining the project layout (5 minutes)

Once you have created the app, let's have a look at it's content:

* `build.gradle` is the main Gradle build file.
* `src/main/groovy` is the package root for your Groovy classes (as in all Gradle/Maven applications).
* `src/ratpack` contains Ratpack specific artifacts. The most important one is `Ratpack.groovy` which contains the Ratpack DSL. If you take a look at it, you will find it similar to the script we created in the previous exercise.
* `src/test/groovy` will containt your Spock tests.
