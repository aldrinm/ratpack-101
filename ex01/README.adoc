== Hello World using a Groovy script (15 minutes)

The simplest way of creating a Ratpack application is using a Groovy script. Create a file named `ratpack.groovy` with the following content:

[source,groovy]
----
include::solution/ratpack.groovy[]
----

What you see there is the Groovy DSL for Ratpack. Those not yet familiar with it, can try to guess what it's defined there: 2 handlers for HTTP GET requests. We will explore handlers later.

Now let's run that. Go to your terminal and run:

 $ groovy ratpack.groovy
 
The first time you run it, it might take a while for http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html[Grape] to resolve the dependencies.

TIP: You can use the JVM parameter `-Dgroovy.grape.report.downloads=true` to get output information about dependencies resolution.

Once it has finished, you can point your browser to http://localhost:5050 or http://localhost:5050/Spring%20IO
